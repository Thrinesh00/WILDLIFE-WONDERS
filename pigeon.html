            <h2>About the Pigeonn</h2>
            <h3>Flight</h3>
            Pigeons are strong and fast fliers with long wings and powerful flight muscles. They can fly at speeds of up to 92.5 miles per hour and reach altitudes of over 6,000 feet. 
             
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            Pigeons are known for their navigation skills. They use the Earth's magnetic field and the sun to determine their altitude and direction. 
             
            <h3>Hearing</h3>
            Pigeons have exceptional hearing and can sense sounds at much lower frequencies than humans. This allows them to hear distant storms and volcanoes. 
             
           <h3> Domestication</h3>
            Pigeons were domesticated in the Mediterranean at least 2,000–5,000 years ago. They have been used for food, pets, holy animals, and messengers. 
             
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            Pigeons are monogamous and mate for life. They are also very social and can be seen in flocks of 20–30 birds. 
             
            <h3>Intelligence</h3>
            Pigeons are considered to be clever and sophisticated. They are one of the few species that can pass the mirror test, a test of self-recognition. 
            
              <h3>Habitat:</h3>
