            <h2>About the Lion</h2>
            <p>The lion is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is native to Africa and India. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are powerful predators.</p>
            <h3>Scientific Name:</h3>
            <p>Panthera leo</p>
           <h3> Habitat</h3>
Lions live in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, savannas, open woodlands, and dense scrub. They are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara, but a small population of Asiatic lions live in India's Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. 
 
<h3>Social structure</h3>
Lions are the most social felines and live in groups called prides. Prides can have up to 30 lions, depending on the availability of food and water. Female lions are the primary hunters, while males guard the pride's territory and young. 
 
<h3>Diet</h3>
Lions are apex predators that primarily eat large animals, such as zebras and wildebeests. 
 
<h3>Lifespan</h3>
In the wild, a lioness may live up to 16 years, but males rarely live past the age of 12. In zoos, lions may live into their late teens or early 20s. 
 
<h3>Other characteristics</h3>
Lions have strong teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. They have an imperious roar and their footprints are called pug marks. 

            <h3>Habitat:</h3>
