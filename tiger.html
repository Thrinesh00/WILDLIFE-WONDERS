            <h2>About the Tiger</h2>
            <p>Among the largest species of cats in the world, tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They range across Asia from Russia all the way to Sumatra and mainland Southeast Asia. Scientists still have much to learn about these beautiful, endangered cats.</p>
            <h3>Scientific Name:</h3>
            <p>Panthera tigris</p>
          <h3>  Size</h3>
Tigers are among the largest cats in the world, with the Siberian tiger being the largest at up to 13 feet long and 660 pounds. 
 
<h3>Appearance</h3>

<h3>Habitat</h3>
Tigers live in a variety of habitats, including rainforests, grasslands, savannas, and mangrove swamps. 
 
<h3>Hunting</h3>
Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws, and agile bodies. They are also adept swimmers and have been recorded hunting in the water. 
 
<h3>Behavior</h3>
Tigers are solitary creatures, except when mating or raising young. They communicate through visual signals, scent marks, and vocalizations. 
 
<h3>Endangered</h3>
Tigers are endangered and vulnerable to extinction. Poaching for their parts and loss of habitat to human activity are the main threats to their survival. 
 
<h3>Role in the ecosystem</h3>
Tigers are top predators that play a vital role in the health and diversity of an ecosystem. They keep the population of wild ungulates in check, thereby maintaining the balance between herbivores and the vegetation upon which they feed.
